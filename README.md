Half wave rectifier

The operation of the half wave rectifier depends on the unidirectional behavior of a diode:

Positive Half-Cycle:
The diode becomes forward-biased.
It conducts current through the load resistor.
Output voltage across R<sub>L</sub> follows the positive half of the AC waveform.

Negative Half-Cycle:
The diode becomes reverse-biased.
It blocks current.
Output voltage = 0 V across R Load.

Thus, only the positive half of the AC signal is present at the output.

Full wave Rectifier:

Positive Half-Cycle:

Diode D1 conducts.
Diode D2 is reverse-biased.
Current flows through the load in one direction.

Negative Half-Cycle:

Diode D2 conducts.
Diode D1 is reverse-biased.
Current still flows through the load in the same direction.
